<p>Description: The Doppler Effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It's commonly observed in sound waves, where the pitch appears higher as the source approaches and lower as it moves away. This phenomenon is utilized in various applications, including radar systems, ultrasound technology, and astronomy, to determine relative motion and distances.</p>

<div class="video-description">
                <p>Description: Momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object possesses. It is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. In simpler terms, momentum measures how difficult it is to stop an object that is moving. The greater an object's mass or velocity, the greater its momentum. Momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction, and it obeys the principle of conservation of momentum in isolated systems.</p>

                <p>Description: The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when it absorbs electromagnetic radiation, typically light. This emission occurs when the energy of the absorbed photons is sufficient to overcome the binding energy holding the electrons within the material. The photoelectric effect is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and has various applications, including solar cells and photodetectors.</p>

                <p>Description: Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons towards itself when it is participating in a chemical bond. It quantifies the atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons. Elements with higher electronegativity values tend to attract electrons more strongly, leading to unequal sharing in covalent bonds. Electronegativity is crucial in understanding the nature of chemical bonds, polarity of molecules, and the reactivity of chemical elements.</p>

                <p>Description: Henry's Law states that the amount of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid, provided that the gas and liquid are in equilibrium and the temperature remains constant. In simpler terms, it describes how the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid depends on the pressure of the gas above the liquid.</p>
